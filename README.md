[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/nihil0/MLOps/_apis/build/status/nihil0.mlops?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/nihil0/MLOps/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

Some demos on how to do MLOps with Azure ML Serivce in R and Python

There are two applications here:

- componentnotes: trains a neural network model for NLP and deploys as a request-response API
- iris: trains a simple classifier in R and uses data factory to orchestrate training and batch scoring
